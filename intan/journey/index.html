                      Remmy sends Intan a message for the first time after their mutual friend Nico wants them to get to know each other. 
                      Remmy, who works in Germany, is currently in Jakarta with his family for the Idul Fitri holiday and Intan is studying at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. 
                      They are 5,410 km apart. The time difference is three hours.

                      <h3>First Video Call</h3>
                      Remmy is back in Erlangen, Germany. They are currently 15,954 km and 8 hours apart.
                      Remmy asks Intan for a video call. They have not seen each other since their first message.
                      Intan also jokingly says that she wants to make sure that Remmy is not a robot.
                      They are both nervous, but finally meet on Google Meet for the first time. Remmy uses the robot filter as an inside joke that he is a robot.
                      When they first meet, they play games like Geoguessr, Globle, and Worldle together because they both like geography.

                      <h3>Communication Continues</h3>
                      Even though they are far apart, they communicate intensely and consistently through messages and video calls. They try to understand each other better, align their values, and deepen their feelings for each other.         
                      They try to schedule a video call at least once a week. During the week, either Remmy accompanies Intan to study or Intan accompanies Remmy to work, just to keep each other company.
                      On weekends, they watch films, listen to music, or watch badminton together among many other activities. Note that they are not officially a couple, yet...

                      Intan finishes her assignments for the semester. Remmy finally confesses his love to Intan on a video call, and the feeling is mutual.
                      They are officially a couple, although they never meet physically. 
                      Some people would say it is crazy, but they ignore it and go on with their relationship and strengthen their bond with each other.
                      Remmy promises to visit Intan in Brisbane during the holidays to prove that he is serious about their relationship.

                      <h3>First Physical Meeting in Brisbane</h3>   
                      It is summer break in Germany and winter break in Australia. Yes, they are in different hemispheres, so the seasons are the opposite of each other.
                      Remmy goes on holiday to Indonesia, but also to Brisbane, Australia, to fulfil his promise to Intan.
                      It is in Brisbane that they finally meet physically for the first time. The doubts that once existed about their relationship begin to crumble. 
                      Intan is still in the middle of her semester, but is kind enough to accompany Remmy as a tourist. In the same spirit, Remmy accompanies Intan as she studies and goes to her lecture.
                      In spite of that, they still manage to go on picnics, culinary tours, and road trips to Toowoomba, Sunshine Coast, and the Ekka Festival.
                      They had a blast but it is another goodbye for now. Nevertheless, they plan to meet each other again in December.

                      It is finally winter break in Germany and summer break in Australia. Intan is back in Aceh and Remmy is back in Jakarta to see their respective family.
                      They agree to go on holiday to Malaysia. They meet in Penang for culinary tours, then go to Kuala Lumpur and Malacca.  
                      It is the first time they have travelled together by plane and bus.

                      They attend Intan's best friend's wedding and once again go on culinary tours around Jakarta from the list they (mostly Intan) saved together on Instagram.

                      After seeing each other for two weeks, unfortunately, it is time for another goodbye and they are both back in their respective countries. 
                      Remmy's work contract in Germany ends in May. Remmy also hopes to move closer to Intan to minimise the distance.
                      They plan to meet again during the winter break in Australia.
